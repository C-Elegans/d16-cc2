# D16 C- Compiler
This is a work in progress compiler for the [D16 cpu](https://github.com/C-Elegans/d16) defined in another project.
The compiler compiles a small subset of C, called C-, which is defined [here](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs57/Project/C-%20Spec.pdf).

## Building
Currently, it can only be built on mac, via `xcodebuild` but a generic autotools build script will be added shortly.
